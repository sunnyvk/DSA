            So, x = 0000000000000......11 (50 bits)
            So, let's say a = 101......000000000001 (50 bits)
                          x = 0000000000000......11 (50 bits, but only starting 2 bits matter)
            
            Now, notice that for a^x, From 49th bit to nth bit will be same as what is present in 'a'
            Hence the extra for loop below takes care of that
